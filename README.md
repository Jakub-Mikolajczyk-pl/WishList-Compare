# WishList-Compare
Objective of this project is to make purchases of books/audiobooks/ebooks simpler based on Your wishlists from goodreads (later from other services).

When Your wishlist is getting bigger, it's hard to remember all the books You wanted to read. And when the big promotion comes in with hundreds of titles its time consuming to filter the lists based by one by one position from Your wishlist.

This project is will try to help with that, by scrapping/getting list of positions from shops, audiobook apps, free libraries - comparing Your big wishlist with the positions available at those places.

At the start it will require from You to download Your wishlist extract from goodreads - You can do this here -> https://www.goodreads.com/review/import
Upload it through simple site for backend and choose shops/paste link for the promotion to analize with Your wishlist.
